# geometry-rush
My first major project, a top-down shooter videogame written in Python 3 with the PyGame library.

## About
This project was originally made in 2019, recently refactored to have better code readability and general project structure. The documentation is written in Croatian.
Almost all of the sprites where made by me with tools on www.pixilart.com, MS Paint and Photoshop. The sound files where downloaded from freesound.org and modified to fit the game.

## How to play
Requires Python 3 and the PyGame library

1. Install PyGame with pip: `pip install pygame` or `py -m pip install pygame`
2. Clone/download the repository.
3. Open Command Prompt, positioned in the root of the downloaded project and run this command: `py "Geometry Rush.py"`
